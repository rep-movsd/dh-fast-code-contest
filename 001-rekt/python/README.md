# rekt tester for python

## Instructions for the writing your python module

Your module need to contain 3 functions:

1. init
    - We pass the path to file containing points
2. run
    - We pass a list of rectangles, where each rectangle
      is represented by a tuple: (x1, x2, y1, y2)
3. results
    - We pass the path to the file where you must write your results

## Instructions for testing/running your python module

    python3 rekt.py oxalorgs_submission.py

Change the constants below to your liking. Including the GUID.

**@rep-movsd: Please change the 'SECRET' constant so 
that someone can't hack around ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)**

*PS: I enjoyed  writing this test code more than 
trying to compete in the competition.*

*PSS: I think I'll be the only guy submitting in python :feelsbadman:*
